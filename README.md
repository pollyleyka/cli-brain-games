# Project decription
"Brain Games" is a set of five console games inspired by popular mobile brain-pumping apps. Each game asks questions to be answered correctly. Once three correct answers are given, the game ends. Incorrect answers end the game and prompt you to play it again.

The games are:
* Brain even: determining an even number.
* Brain calculator: calculate random arithmetic expressions.
* Brain gcd: determining the greatest common divisor.
* Brain progression: find missing numbers in a number sequence.
* Brain prime: determining a prime number.
